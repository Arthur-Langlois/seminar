# An Inquiry into the Differential Impacts Across States of Gun-Control Legislations following the 2018 Parkland High School Shooting

Following the 2018 Parkland school shooting, about half of the states passed at least one legislation with to limit gun access. The goal of this empirical project is to measure to extent to which the gun-restricting policies implemented following the 2018 Parkland shooting were successful in reducing gun violence across states. We will use states that have not implemented policies as a synthetic control group, to assess the causal relationship between legislation and gun violence. The combination of high societal costs of gun violence along with the importance place it has taken in political debate calls for the need of rigorous assessment of policies effectiveness aiming at reducing gun violence. We hope the results of this research can provide guidance to policymakers and the general public at large regarding the effectiveness of these crucial policies.
